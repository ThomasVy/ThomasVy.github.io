	<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
	<p>I am Thomas Vy, a third year Software Engineering student at University of Calgary.  I chose to go to UofC because I was born and raised in Calgary and most of my friends and families live in Calgary. I previously graduated from John G. Diefenbaker high school in Calgary, AB, Canada. </p>
    
    <h1>Why did I choose Software Engineering?</h1>
    <p>Coming out of highschool, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my future. In highschool, my grades in the Sciences(Physics, Biology, and Chemistry) and Math were in the high 90s, and I enjoyed those subjects, but I didn't want to do the same thing as everyone else. After hearing my situation, my sister recommended me to pursue Geology and I remembered when I was in elementary, I found the Geology section of my class to be interesting, so I followed my sister's advice. </p>
    
    <p>My initial degree and how I entered the University of Calgary was Geology, but when my first year of university came, I quickly found out I didn't have a passion for Geology. I was conflicted on what I wanted to do; do I follow the difficult path of Engineering or do I stay in the degree that I didn't find appealing. I decide that it was time to try Engineering, specially Electical Engineering, I knew that the average to get into Engineering was high and I had a change of not getting in, but I tried, and I studied hard; after all that hard work, I was successfully able to enter Engineering. I was scared. I've heard the horror stories of Engineering and I was tackling all the challenges of Engineering without my friends. Forunately, I found a friend from highschool that was in Biological Sciences and transferred into Engineering at the same time as me, his name is Kevin. He helped me so much in my first year of Engineering; he always seemed to have his stuff together, and he gave inspiration and helped me through the tough times of Engineering. We eventually had to split because we wanted to choose separate Engineering paths; I wanted to go to Software Engineering and he wanted to go to Mechanical Engineering.</p>
    
    <p>I chose Software Engineering because I had this class in first year Engineering called <a href='http://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/enel/courses/f18/ENGG233'>ENGG 233</a>, where they taught me Processing (Similar to Arduino) and the fundamentals of programming. I had no prior experience with programming before that class, but after taking that course I immediately fell in love with programming. Programming in that class gave me a sense of euphoria whenever my code worked. In that class, I created this billard game, and when I got something to work successfully in the game, it was one of the best feelings that I ever had. When I handed in the game for the class, I was extremely happy with the outcome, but I was sad that the coding class was over. That was when I decided I wanted to do Software Engineering. That was in fall 2016, and I have never regreted my decision.</p>
